-BUGS-
(Implementation reduce standard to s and perpetual to p arguments.) attempted but failed
alerts that are curerntly in the database before app starts should also be triggered.

What is the normal convention to save a user's current alerts in the case that the bot has to shut down?
Is this just saved in the current alert database? And then rechecked or added to the subscribers' list when the bot reboots?
How do you handle a situation like this, what is the normal convention?

Is the websocket starting up on bot boot every time, or only started when an alert command is sent,
and should this be active on boot and load all the active alerts in the subscriber list? How can this be handled at scale for multiple users?

Add a timestamp in the response for the alert.

There needs to be a timestamp in the message response to the user when the alert is triggered.

The show alerts should show a simplified timestamp for creation time as well as the type of alert.


-TESTING-
test other pairs and different onse at the same time
